- replace all the datetime timestamp stuff with an accessor/setter on the database field
- maybe a discord.py check for not following any queries
- maybe `/compact` that minimises the number of separate queries you have by joining them?
- more advanced tag normalisation and deduplication, has to be aware of e621 parenthesis syntax
    though
