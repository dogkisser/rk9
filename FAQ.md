## Blacklist vs. Prefix

The prefix is a query applied to every e621 search. This means it contributes to your tag limit (40)
but can contain anything you want.

The blacklist is a list of tags (so no [advanced query syntax](https://e621.net/help/cheatsheet))
and is applied by /rk9/, so it can be as long as you want, but can only filter away posts.
